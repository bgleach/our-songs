  <h1> Come on Eileen </h1>
  <h2> Dexys Midnight Runners </h2>
    <p>Come on Eileen<br>Come on Eileen</p>

    <p>Poor old Johnny Ray<br>
    Sounded sad upon the radio<br>
    But he moved a million hearts in mono<br>
    Our mothers cried, sang along, who'd blame them</p>

    <p>You're grown (so grown up)<br>
    So grown (so grown up) now I must say more than ever<br>
    Come on Eileen<br>
    Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye aye<br>
    And we can sing just like our fathers</p>

    <p>Come on Eileen, oh I swear (what he means)<br>
    At this moment, you mean everything<br>
    You in that dress, my thoughts I confess<br>
    Verge on dirty<br>
    Ah, come on Eileen</p>

    <p>Come on Eileen</p>

    <p>These people 'round here<br>
    Wear beat down eyes sunk in smoke dried faces<br>
    They're resigned to what their fate is<br>
    But not us, (no never) no not us (no never)<br>
    We are far to young and clever<br>
    Remember<br>
    Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye aye<br>
    And you'l hum this tune forever</p>

    <p>Come on Eileen oh I swear (what he means)<br>
    Ah come on lets, take off everything<br>
    That pretty red dress, Eileen (tell him yes)<br>
    Ah come on lets, ah come on Eileen<br>
    That pretty red dress, Eileen (tell him yes)<br>
    Ah come on lets, ah come on Eileen, please</p>

    <p>Come on Eileen too rye aye<br>
    Come on Eileen too rye aye<br>
    Now you're full grown<br>
    Now you have shown<br>
    Oh, Eileen</p>

    <p>Said, come on Eileen<br>
    These things they are real and I know<br>
    How you feel<br>
    Now I must say more than ever<br>
    Things round here have changed<br>
    I say, too ra loo ra, too ra-loo rye aye</p>

    <p>Come on Eileen<br>
    Oh, I swear (what he means)<br>
    At this moment, you mean everything<br>
    You in that dress, my thoughts I confess<br>
    Verge on dirty<br>
    Aah, come on Eileen</p>

    <p>Oh, come on Eileen<br>
    Oh, I swear (what he means)<br>
    At this moment, you mean everything<br>
    In that dress, oh my thoughts I confess<br>
    Well, they're dirty<br>
    Come on Eileen</p>

    <p>Come on Eileen</p>
